# Roadmap

Infrastructure improvements deferred for future consideration.

## Structured Logging

Replace ad-hoc `print()` calls across pipeline scripts with Python `logging` at
INFO/DEBUG levels. Long-running intervention and activation-extraction jobs
benefit from timestamped, level-filtered output -- especially with the
suspend/resume workflow on Pop!_OS where post-wake debugging currently relies on
scrollback grep.

## AGENTS.md Staleness Detection

AGENTS.md goes stale when codebase behaviour changes --
e.g. a new shared module is extracted, test infrastructure is added, or a
workflow step is removed -- but nobody updates the guidelines.

Possible approaches:
- A pre-commit hook that flags when files in `scripts/` or `tests/` change but
  AGENTS.md does not (noisy, but catches the obvious case).
- A periodic `/readiness-report`-style agent task that diffs AGENTS.md claims
  against the actual file tree and import graph.
- Convention: any commit that changes project structure or workflow must include
  a corresponding AGENTS.md update (enforced by review, not tooling).
